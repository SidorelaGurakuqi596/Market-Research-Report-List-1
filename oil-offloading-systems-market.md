<p><strong>The Oil Offloading Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CBM (Conventional Buoy Mooring)</li><li>SPM (Single Point Mooring)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oil offloading systems market primarily includes two types: Conventional Buoy Mooring (CBM) and Single Point Mooring (SPM). CBM systems utilize multiple lines to secure moored vessels for loading and unloading operations, typically in shallow waters. In contrast, SPM systems feature a single buoy anchored to the seabed, allowing vessels to maneuver freely around the mooring point, which is ideal for deep-water applications. Both systems are crucial for efficient oil transportation and storage in offshore environments.</p></p>
